# EchoShift Community Code of Conduct (In the Spirit of x-raen)

## x-raen's Pledge:

In our endeavor to make EchoShift an open and welcoming project, we, as contributors and maintainers (led by x-raen's vision), pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

x-raen is committed to fostering a culture of creativity and mutual respect, where ideas can flourish freely and safely.

## x-raen's Standards (What We Expect from You):

To help create a positive environment, we expect all contributors and participants to:

*   **Use welcoming and inclusive language:** Communicate in a way that reflects mutual respect. x-raen values words that build bridges.
*   **Respect different viewpoints and experiences:** Contributors may come from diverse backgrounds. Be open to learning from others.
*   **Gracefully accept constructive criticism:** Criticism is a natural part of the development process. Focus on ideas, not people. x-raen sees criticism as an opportunity for growth.
*   **Focus on what is best for the community:** Make decisions that benefit the EchoShift project as a whole.
*   **Show empathy towards other community members:** Remember that behind every username is a human being. Treat others as you would like to be treated.

## Unacceptable Behaviors (What x-raen Rejects):

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting aimed at creativity and collaboration.

## x-raen's Responsibilities (And the Maintainer Team's):

Project maintainers (guided by x-raen) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope of x-raen's Vision:

This Code of Conduct applies within all EchoShift project spaces (such as the GitHub repository, Issues lists, Pull Requests) and when an individual is representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project may include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations (Notifying x-raen):

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [An email address for contact will be specified here by x-raen]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership (guided by x-raen).
