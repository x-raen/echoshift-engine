## Overview

EchoShift is an advanced, modular tool designed for intelligent transformation and adaptation of Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) chains. It addresses the critical challenge of porting exploit chains across different firmware versions, environments, or architectures by providing a methodical, deeply analytical, and semi-automated approach to transferring these complex sequences.

In the dynamic landscape of embedded systems security and vulnerability research, exploit chains often break due to minor or major changes in code layout, available gadgets, memory protections, or even instruction set differences. EchoShift tackles this by semantically disassembling, analyzing, and creatively reconstructing exploit chains, always prioritizing semantic equivalence and robust compatibility with the target environment.

## Core Philosophy

This project is not merely a collection of scripts; it is the embodiment of a research philosophy. EchoShift is designed as a powerful assistant to the security researcher, automating tedious aspects of chain transformation while providing deep insights and control. It supports a blend of symbolic execution, semantic analysis, and inference-driven equivalence to achieve its goals.

---

## Core Architectural Pillars

EchoShift is built upon three fundamental pillars, each a sophisticated module:

### 🔍 Semantic Disassembly Unit (SDU)
The vanguard of the transformation process. The SDU meticulously analyzes input ROP/JOP chains (raw, disassembled, or annotated) and breaks them down into essential "functional segments." It employs an enriched Instruction Semantics Knowledge Base (ISKB) and a custom-built Bounded Symbolic Execution Engine (BSEE) to deeply understand the precise purpose, effect, and context of each segment and its constituent gadgets.

### 🧠 Advanced Gadget Equivalence Engine (AGEE)
The intellectual core for finding functional alternatives. When the SDU identifies segments or individual gadgets that are non-portable or suboptimal for the target environment, AGEE takes responsibility. It leverages advanced semantic fingerprinting and comparison algorithms to search a comprehensive database of gadgets (from the target firmware/binary) for semantically equivalent alternatives. AGEE considers register states, memory effects, control flow changes, and operational constraints to suggest viable alternatives.

### 🛠️ Reconstruction and Patching Unit (RPU)
The master craftsman that forges the new chain. The RPU intelligently integrates the original chain structure (as understood by the SDU) with the equivalent alternatives suggested by AGEE. It assembles a new, functional, and optimized ROP/JOP chain tailored for the target environment. This complex process involves:

- **Strategic selection** of the most appropriate alternatives based on configurable heuristics (e.g., chain length, performance, bad character avoidance).
- **Generation of "glue code"** – precise, small gadget sequences to seamlessly connect disparate functional segments, ensuring correct data flow and state transition.
- **Application of critical patches and adaptations** to handle target-specific constraints, such as bad character avoidance, stack alignment, and register preservation.

### 📦 Modular and Extensible Design
Each unit (SDU, AGEE, RPU) is designed for modularity, facilitating independent development, rigorous testing, and future enhancements. This design philosophy allows EchoShift to adapt and grow.

### 📚 Comprehensive Knowledge Bases
The ISKB and AGEE gadget databases are designed for expansion, enabling support for new CPU architectures, instruction sets, and exploitation techniques.

<summary>View usage example</summary>

```python
# Assuming a main API interface or direct module interaction.
# The following is a conceptual illustration of how one would interact with the system.

# from echoshift.sdu.sdu_api import SDU_Interface # Hypothetical API
# from echoshift.agee.agee_api import AGEE_Interface # Hypothetical API
# from echoshift.rpu.reconstruction_manager import ReconstructionManager

# target_info_example = {
#    "architecture": "x86_64",
#    "bad_chars": ["\x00", "\x0a"],
#    "gadget_db_path": "path/to/target_gadget_database.db" # Path to target binary's gadget database
# }

# # 1. Initialize EchoShift components (actual initialization would be module-specific)
# # sdu_processor = SDU_Interface(target_info_example)
# # agee_engine = AGEE_Interface(target_info_example)
# # rpu_manager = ReconstructionManager(target_info_example)

# # 2. SDU: Analyze the original exploit chain
# original_chain_input = "0x400100; 0x400102; # pop rax; ret; pop rbx; ret\n0x400104; # add rax, rbx; ret"
# # sdu_analysis_result = sdu_processor.process_chain(original_chain_input)
# # Example: sdu_analysis_result = MockSDUOutput([...]) # Using a mock from tests for illustration

# # 3. AGEE: Find equivalent gadgets for non-portable segments
# # agee_alternatives_map = agee_engine.find_all_equivalents(sdu_analysis_result)
# # Example: agee_alternatives_map = {"segment_id_needing_alt": [MockAGEEAlternative(...)]}

# # 4. RPU: Reconstruct the new chain
# # new_chain, report = rpu_manager.manage_reconstruction_pipeline(
# #    sdu_analysis_result,
# #    agee_alternatives_map,
# #    strategy={"preference": "avoid_bad_chars", "on_missing_critical": "fail"}
# # )

# # print(f"EchoShift Transformed Chain: {new_chain}")
# # print(f"Transformation Report:\n{json.dumps(report, indent=2)}")
print("EchoShift: High-level usage example. See module APIs and documentation for operational details.")
```
