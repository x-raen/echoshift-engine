# RPU: Patching Engine - x-raen's Art of Adaptation and Refinement

"""
This is the Patching Engine module, a critical component of x-raen's RPU.
Its purpose is to apply necessary modifications and adaptations to a sequence of gadgets
to ensure it functions correctly and safely within the target environment.
This includes handling bad characters, adjusting immediate values, ensuring stack alignment,
and applying any custom adaptation rules.

        # Actual logic will involve:
        # 1. Bad Character Handling:
        #    - Iterate through each gadget address and any immediate values within gadgets.
        #    - If a bad character (from self.target_info.get("bad_chars") or adaptation_rules) is found,
        #      attempt to find an alternative gadget without bad chars, or apply encoding techniques
        #      (like XORing) if gadgets support it and can be decoded later.
        #    - This may require interaction with an AGEE-like gadget database.
        
        # 2. Immediate Value Adjustment:
        #    - If some gadgets require immediate values that depend on target environment specifics
        #      (e.g., addresses of functions, global variables), these values must be updated.
        #      This requires semantic understanding of the gadgets.

        # 3. Stack Alignment:
        #    - Analyze the chain's effect on the stack pointer (RSP/ESP).
        #    - If the target environment requires specific alignment (e.g., 16-byte alignment before function calls),
        #      it might be necessary to insert gadgets to adjust the stack (e.g., "sub rsp, 8; ret").
